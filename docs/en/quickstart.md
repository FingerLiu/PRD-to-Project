# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you create your first AI-driven, iterative, and collaborative project in under 10 minutes. Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, or WeChat Mini Program, follow these steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install an AI-Powered IDE

Currently supported:
- [Windsurf IDE](https://windsurf.app) (Recommended)

Coming soon:
- Cursor
- Devin
- Mars Code

### 2. Choose Your PRD Template

Visit our [GitHub Template Repository](https://github.com/PRD-to-Project/templates) to find a template that matches your:
- Project type (Web/App/Mini Program)
- Tech stack
- Project scale

Each template includes:
1. **Structured PRD File**
   - Product requirements
   - Technical specifications
   - Testing requirements
   - [Learn more about PRD structure](../concepts/prd-structure.md)

2. **Windsurfrules Configuration**
   - Project setup rules
   - Code style guidelines
   - AI collaboration settings
   - [Learn more about Windsurfrules](../concepts/windsurfrules.md)

To use a template:
1. Navigate to your chosen template in our GitHub repository
2. Click the "Use this template" button
3. Name your new repository
4. Choose visibility (public/private)
5. Click "Create repository from template"

## Getting Started

### 1. Open Your Project in Windsurf

1. Open Windsurf IDE
2. Click `File > New Project from Git`
3. Enter your GitHub repository URL
4. Click `Clone and Open`

### 2. Start Development

#### Background
Our `.windsurfrules` configuration specifies development guidelines for different tech stacks, including:
- Development tools
- Dependency management
- Testing frameworks
- Deployment tools

The AI will act as a specialized engineer for your chosen tech stack, selecting the most appropriate tools and practices.

#### Developing Version 1.0

1. Edit the `PRD.md` file in your template:
   - Fill in your actual requirements
   - Define features and specifications
   - Set project constraints

2. Start AI collaboration:
   - Type "Start development" in Windsurf
   - The AI will:
     - Analyze your PRD
     - Plan development tasks
     - Generate code
     - Set up project structure

3. Review and refine:
   - Check generated code
   - Provide feedback
   - Request modifications

### 3. Debug and Test

1. Preview your application:
   ```
   Type "preview" to:
   - Start development server
   - Open preview window
   - Enable hot-reload
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```
   Type "test" to:
   - Run unit tests
   - Check code coverage
   - Perform integration tests
   ```

3. Performance testing:
   ```
   Type "benchmark" to:
   - Check load times
   - Analyze performance
   - Get optimization suggestions
   ```

### 4. Deploy

1. Prepare for deployment:
   ```
   Type "deploy" to:
   - Build production version
   - Run pre-deployment checks
   - Generate deployment assets
   ```

2. Follow deployment guide:
   - [Web App Deployment](../how-to/deploy-web.md)
   - [Mobile App Publishing](../how-to/deploy-mobile.md)
   - [Mini Program Release](../how-to/deploy-miniprogram.md)

### 5. Iterate and Update

When developing new major versions:

1. Create new PRD file:
   ```
   PRD-2.0.md
   PRD-3.0.md
   etc.
   ```

2. The AI will:
   - Detect new PRD files
   - Plan version updates
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

3. Version management:
   - Each major version gets its own PRD
   - Changes are tracked in CHANGELOG.md
   - Dependencies are updated automatically
   - Documentation is versioned
